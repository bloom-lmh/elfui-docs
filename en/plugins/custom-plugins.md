# Custom plugin

Plugins can be written as functions:

```ts{1,3}
import type { ElfUIAppPluginFn } from "@elfui/core";

export const focusPlugin: ElfUIAppPluginFn = (app) => {
  app.directive("focus", {
    mounted(el) {
      (el as HTMLElement).focus();
    }
  });
};
```

It can also be written as an object:

```ts{1,3}
import type { ElfUIAppPluginObject } from "@elfui/core";

export const appPlugin: ElfUIAppPluginObject<{ appName?: string }> = {
  install(app, options) {
    if (options?.appName) {
      app.config.globalProperties.appName = options.appName;
    }
  }
};
```

## App instance

What the plug-in gets is the application instance created by `createApp()`:

| Members | Role |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `app.directive(name, def)` | Register the command of the current App; commands with the same name will not be used in conjunction with other Apps |
| `app.component(component)` | Ensure that the component is registered to the browser according to its own compile-time tag `customElements` global registry |
| `app.provide(key, value)` | Inject application-level dependencies |
| `app.config` | Application level configuration |

::: warning
In the same app instance, the same plug-in object will only be installed once. `provide/config/directive` is isolated by App; Custom Element tags are managed by the browser global registry, so different Apps cannot register different constructors for the same tag.
